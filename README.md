# bSigner
Multisignature feature on the Stellar Network with ease.

## Main features:
- Host transaction to request for signatures with open APIs
- Receive sign transaction request and real-time status updates with PUSH notifications
- Backup and recover accounts with mnemonics
- Protect your signers with PIN and biometric authentication
- Available for Android and iOS devices

## How it works?
bSigner interacts with these informations:
- **TransactionXDR**: Transaction need to collects signature
- **Device Id**: Push notification's identity id
- **Public Key**: Signer's public key
- **Signature**: Generated by using private key to sign transaction's hash

When a transaction was hosted by using open APIs, bSigner server will queries transaction's source account on Stellar Network to find all required signers and send PUSH notification to all devices have them. 
Users use bSigner app to approve a transaction, bSigner server will collects signatures and return to the owner.

## Warning
- **Private Key** is stored locally on user's device, it is used to generates signature by signing transaction's hash when users approve a transaction.
- bSigner server only collects **Signatures** and return them to transaction owner using webhook, bSigner doesn't spontaneously submit transaction to the Stellar Network.
- bSigner Android and bSigner iOS app are also available in public on Github

## Intergrate
**Contact us at luvapay@gmail.com to register your webhook url**

To intergrate Luvapay bSigner with your service, please follow the simple steps below:

**Make a POST request to: https://bsignerapi.luvapay.com/transaction/host with request body:**
```go
//json object
{
  xdr: "transaction_xdr",
  name: "transaction_custom_name",
  signature: "source_account_signature" //optional, to verify owner
}
```
***Currently, we only support payment operation for transaction***

If transaction was hosted with a source account's signature, only owner can interact with it by using APIs with signature. 
Without signature, bSigner will start to collects signatures nomarlly but anyone can interact with it like modify it's custom name, remove it by using APIs

**bSigner will send result to your webhook url when collected all required signatures**
```go
//json object
{
  xdr: "transaction_xdr",
  signatures: [
    { public_key: "signer_public_key", signature: "signer_signature" },
    ...
  ] 
}
```
